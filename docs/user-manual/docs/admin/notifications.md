# Notifications

!!! info "Status"
    **Built and in use** — SMTP wiring + four workflow surfaces live as of v0.3 (2026-05-27). UPD / GRM / citizen email notifications remain blocked on Keycloak User-table sync.

Transactional email goes out at every lifecycle transition that has a clear external party to notify. The system uses one shared helper (`apps.security.notifications.send_notification`) so audit emission, recipient normalisation, and fail-silently semantics are identical across every consumer.

## Workflow → recipient matrix

| Workflow | Trigger | Recipients | Audit action |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PMT** — submit for sign-off | `submit_for_approval` | MGLSD Steward (step 2) | `pmt.signoff.notified` |
| **PMT** — chain advances | `sign_step` (not last) | Next pending signer (UBOS DG) | `pmt.signoff.notified` |
| **PMT** — model activated | `sign_step` (final) | Author + every prior signer | `pmt.activation.notified` |
| **PMT** — rejected | `reject_step` | Author (verbatim reason) | `pmt.rejection.notified` |
| **DSA** — chain advances | `record_signature` (next is in-console) | Next pending signer | `dsa.signoff.notified` |
| **DSA** — activated | `record_signature` (final) | Every signer + `Partner.primary_email` | `dsa.activation.notified` |
| **DSA** — declined | `decline_signature` | Every signer (signed + pending) + `Partner.primary_email`, verbatim reason | `dsa.decline.notified` |
| **Programme** — submit for sign-off | `submit_for_signoff` | NSR Coordinator (step 1) | `programme.signoff.notified` |
| **Programme** — chain advances | `sign_step` (not last) | Next pending signer | `programme.signoff.notified` |
| **Programme** — activated | `sign_step` (final) | Creator + every signer | `programme.activation.notified` |
| **Programme** — rejected | `reject_step` | Every expected signer + creator, verbatim reason | `programme.rejection.notified` |
| **DRS** — approved | `approve_data_request` | `Partner.primary_email` + `DataRequest.requester` | `data_request.approved.notified` |
| **DRS** — rejected | `reject_data_request` | Both, verbatim reason | `data_request.rejected.notified` |
| **DRS** — delivered | `deliver_data_request` | Both, with **manifest SHA-256** + row count + expiry | `data_request.delivered.notified` |
| **DPO** — audit chain break | `verify_audit_chain_task` | `DPO_EMAIL` (env-gated) + Slack webhook | (existing audit row from the verify task) |

The DocuSign envelope for DSA step 1 is sent by DocuSign itself when `PARTNERS_DOCUSIGN_ENABLED=True`. The NSR MIS notification helper deliberately does NOT duplicate that email — it only emails in-console signers (steps 2 + 3).

## How the helper behaves

`send_notification` wraps `django.core.mail.send_mail` with two cross-cutting concerns:

1. **Audit emission.** Every attempt writes an `AuditEvent` linked to the originating entity (PMT model version, DSA, Programme, DataRequest). Three possible actions:
    - `notification.sent` (or the per-workflow code like `pmt.signoff.notified`) — when SMTP accepted the message.
    - `notification.failed` — exception was raised by `send_mail`. The exception class + message are captured in `reason`; the workflow continues anyway. Use this row to triage SMTP outages.
    - `notification.skipped` — no recipients (e.g. `Partner.primary_email` is empty). The row records the subject + a reason so DPO can find the gap.
2. **Fail-silently.** Every exception path catches and audits. PMT activation, DSA signing, etc. never roll back on email failure — the audit-bearing workflow always completes. Email is best-effort; the audit chain is the durable record.

Recipient handling: lists are deduped, blank/None entries are dropped, whitespace is stripped. Multiple roles that happen to resolve to the same email get one mail.

## Nothing is delivered until the mailbox is authenticated

`comms.quasar.ug` rejects any client it has not authenticated — local
recipients as well as external ones:

```
MAIL FROM -> 250 2.1.0 Ok
RCPT TO   -> 554 5.7.1 <unknown[154.72.195.66]>: Client host rejected: Access denied
```

`default_email_backend()` switches to SMTP the moment `EMAIL_HOST_USER`
**or** `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` is set, and falls back to the console
backend otherwise. The console backend accepts every message and
prints it, so `send_mail` succeeds and the notification is audited as
sent. Production ran that way for months with eighteen notifications
recorded as delivered and none of them sent.

To deliver, put the mailbox credentials in the production `.env`:

```
EMAIL_HOST_USER=johnson@quasar.ug
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=<the mailbox password>
```

then restart web + worker + beat. Nothing else changes — `EMAIL_HOST`
is already `comms.quasar.ug:587` with STARTTLS.

Two checks confirm the state rather than assuming it:

- `security.W007` warns on every management command and in the deploy
  output while a non-DEBUG deployment is on a discarding backend.
- Each `notification.sent` audit row carries `delivered` and `backend`,
  so "sent" is verifiable after the fact.

The relay also sees this host as `unknown[154.72.195.66]` — there is no
reverse DNS for it. Authentication fixes the rejection; the missing
PTR record may still cost deliverability with strict receivers.

## Operational gotchas

### Production password rotation

The SMTP password lives in the secrets manager (or local `.env`, gitignored). To rotate:

1. Generate a new password on the `comms.quasar.ug` mailserver for `johnson@quasar.ug`.
2. Update the secret in the secrets manager.
3. Restart the web + celery workers (Django reads env at boot).
4. Smoke-test from the Django shell:
   ```python
   from django.core.mail import send_mail
   send_mail("[NSR MIS] rotation smoke test", "body", None, ["you@example.com"], fail_silently=False)
   ```
5. If the test fails, check the `apps.security.notifications` logs and the `notification.failed` audit rows.

### Empty `Partner.primary_email`

The DSA activation and DRS delivery flows email `Partner.primary_email`. When that field is empty the helper writes a `notification.skipped` row (the workflow still completes). To find partners missing the contact field:

```sql
SELECT id, code, name
FROM partners_partner
WHERE primary_email = '' OR primary_email IS NULL
ORDER BY name;
```

Add the email through `apps/partners/admin.py` or `/api/v1/partners/<id>/` PATCH.

### Why some workflows are NOT yet wired

| Workflow | Blocker |
|---|---|
| UPD change-request approve / reject / hold | `ChangeRequest.requester` is a CharField operator-id, not an email. Needs a Keycloak User-table sync (US-S2-002) before we can resolve requester → inbox. |
| GRM escalation / resolution | `Grievance.assigned_to` and citizen reporter are identifiers, no email fields. |
| Citizen receipt at intake | No household contact email captured on the intake form yet. Future citizen portal work. |
| DDUP merge → enrolled programmes | The programme-link join needs to be modelled before we know who to notify. |

### Reconciling failed notifications

Query the audit chain for delivery gaps:

```python
from apps.security.models import AuditEvent

# Every failed attempt in the last 24 hours
failed = AuditEvent.objects.filter(
    action="notification.failed",
    occurred_at__gte=timezone.now() - timedelta(hours=24),
).order_by("occurred_at")

for event in failed:
    print(event.entity_type, event.entity_id, event.reason)
    print("  subject:", (event.field_changes or {}).get("subject"))
    print("  recipients:", (event.field_changes or {}).get("recipients"))
```

The same query with `action="notification.skipped"` surfaces records where we had nothing to send to — useful for finding data-quality gaps in partner contacts.
